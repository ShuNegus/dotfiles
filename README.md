About
-----

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, which I use on unix systems of
varying flavors, and on my Macs. They are published here because I
occasionally want to share them or use them as examples, and this is an easy
way to do so. Feel free to use anything you find here.

Note however, that I do not make any particular effort to make this easy for
others to use. I randomly move things around, add and remove Vim bundles,
according to my needs. If you want to use these dotfiles, I would definitely
suggest forking them to your own repo so you can selectively merge changes as
you see fit. YMMV.

Compatibility
-------------

I am a Zsh user. This repo goes in conjunction with my
[fork of oh-my-zsh][zfork]. If you want to use my zsh setup, run
`./install.pl zsh`.

Using Bash does not need any external repos. Use `./install.pl bash` to
install my Bash setup. I used Bash for many years, and those files are fairly
mature, but I am no longer paying a lot of attention to them. Note that the
default installer does not install the bash symlinks anymore, you have
to install 'bash' specifically!

I regularly use this setup with Mac OS X, Solaris, and Linux systems. I have
used it with FreeBSD in the past.

Some parts of the Bash, Zsh, and Vim configs may assume you have 256 color
support in your terminal. If you are using Apple Terminal before OS X Lion,
you don't. Try [iTerm2][] instead.

I have written two blog posts on the subject of iTerm and iTerm2. Give them a
read; color support is only one of several good reasons to switch.

[iTerm2 > iTerm](http://tangledhelix.com/blog/2010/12/06/iterm2-iterm/)

Shell colors
------------

The colors in the Zsh shell prompts currently assume the terminal is using
a Cobalt color scheme. They may look odd otherwise.

In Bash, the prompts assume [Solarized][] Dark.

The Zsh setup lets you pick from multiple prompts. Run `prompt -l` to see
them, and set what you like in `~/.zshrc`.

Installation
------------

    umask 0022
    git clone https://github.com/tangledhelix/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

To install my dotfiles as *your* dotfiles, you can create symlinks with
`./install.pl all`. If you do *not* run that command, everything will be
isolated inside of the `~/.dotfiles` directory (or wherever you cloned it)
and will not interfere with your existing environment.

    cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.pl all

Set Zsh as your default shell:

    chsh -s /bin/zsh

`install.pl` will ask you before overwriting any files that already exist.

You can also install subsets of the environment using one of the following.

    ./install.pl bash
    ./install.pl zsh
    ./install.pl vim
    ./install.pl git

Updating
--------

I periodically change the Vim bundles I use. There are two update tasks for
Vim. The first updates the bundles from their repositories.

    ./install.pl update:vim

The second cleans up any bundles which are no longer known. (Note that
`update:vim` will run the cleanup before doing the update step.)

    ./install.pl cleanup:vim

You can refresh the zsh environment with

    ./install.pl update:zsh
